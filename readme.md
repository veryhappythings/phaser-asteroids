= Asteroids for Phaser.js

My first Phaser game. It's not up to much, but you've got to start somewhere
with a new engine.

point_rotation.html is a file I used to get my head around how to offset points
from each other based on rotations. I've used this to move the bullet spawn
location to the front of the player ship.

Thanks to these fine people for the artwork:
